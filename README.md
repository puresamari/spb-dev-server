# Simple Page Builder

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40puresamari%2Fspb-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40puresamari%2Fspb-core)

`SPB` is a really simple build tool, designed to just take input fields and automatically generate files without the hassle of creating a bloated config file.

## Supported files
At the moment, `spb` supports the compilation of `.ts`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.js`, `.twig` and `.pug` files. All other file types defined will just be copied when `watching` or `building` and served when using the `dev-server`. Images will automatically converted to the correct mime type as well.

# CLI

You can find the cli on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@puresamari/spb).
